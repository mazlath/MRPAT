# Maz's Remote Play Anything Together
***NOTICE:*** REQUIRES YOU TO OWN AT LEAST ONE STEAM GAME WITH REMOTE PLAY TOGETHER TO WORK 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a cheeky little work around to get Steam Remote Play Together to work with pretty much any game you want.



Step 1:  Place both files (MRPAT.bat, and GameNameHere.exe) in to the location of a game '.exe' that already has remote play together.

Step 2:  Rename the original games '.exe' to something else  (i recommend just adding -backup to its name).

Step 3:  Rename the GameNameHere.exe to the original game '.exe' name.

Step 4:  Edit the 'MRPAT.bat' and replace the example file path with the file path to the non remote play together game's '.exe' then save the '.bat' file.


Step 5: Run the Remote play together game via Steam

Step 6:??????

Step 7: PROFIT!.... a small cmd prompt will open followed by the game you added to the '.bat' file with Remote Play Together fully ready to go.
